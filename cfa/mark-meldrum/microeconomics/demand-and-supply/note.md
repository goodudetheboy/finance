# Demand and Supply

## Types of Markets

![alt text](image/1-types-of-markets-chart.png)

For Firms, if revenue > economic costs of production, then supply has.

Households are the ultimate owner of all equity and all debts of all firms.

Must be noted that all market interactions are voluntary

## Principles of Demand & Supply

### Demand

> Demand
>
> Definition: The willingness and ability of consumers to purchase a given amount of a good/service at a given price

We have:
> Demand function
>
> Definition: $Q^d_x = f(P_x, I, P_y...)$
> - $P_x$: price
> - $I$: your level of income
> - $P_y$: price of other products that can be substitue or complement

Demand is driven by something called **Law of Demand**.

> Law of Demand
>
> Definition: As $P_x$ goes up, $Q^d_x$ goes down, and vice versa. Layman terms, the higher the price increases, the lower the demand.

We have that: $$Q^d_x = Int - P_x + I - P_y$$

Here, $Int$ is intercept constant term.

$P_y$ if is:
- negative coefficients => complement product
- positive coefficients => substitute product

$I, P_y$ is usually exogenous variables, so typically hold these constant

Thus: $$Q^d_x = Int - coef P_x$$

$$coef P_x = Int - Q^d_x$$

$$P_x = Int/coef - Q^d_x / coef$$

This is called the **inverse demand function**. The price is solved for a given quantity

### Supply

> Supply
>
> Definition: The willingness and ability of sellers to offer a given quantity of a good/service at a given price.

We have:

> Supply function
>
> Definition: $Q^s_x = f(P_x, W...)$

Supply is driven by **Law of Supply**.

> Law of Supply
>
> Definition: As $P_x$ goes up, $Q^s_x$ goes up, and vice versa

We have that: $$Q^s_x = Int + P_x - W$$

(higher production cost will make $Q^s_x$ goes down, that means less people are willing to supply it)

$W$ is exogenous variable, so typically held constant.

Thus:

$$Q^s_x = Int + coef P_x$$

$$ -coefP_x = Int - Q^s_x$$
$$ coefP_x = -Int +Q^s_x$$
$$P_x = -Int/coef + Q^s_x/coef$$

Then:
$$P_x = -Int + coef Q^s_x$$

This is called the inverse supply function.

### Point of Equilibrium

Top chart is Demand curve, mid chart is Supply curve

The cross between demand and supply is called the equilibrium.
